# The Tumbling Dice

### A Basic Dice Roller

The first thing that inspired this project was, back when I wore a teenager's clothes, I had a brief career playing table-top role-playing games. Because of this I have some the 'World of Darkness' storyteller/table-top books. I'd wanted to do some writing and firgured, why not use their system as an aid in helping me write some fiction? This is the reason I created a `<select>` input with nine `<options>` with values ranging from 2 to 10\. The reason is that you'd roll an amount of dice against a difficulty number from 2 to 10\. (How many dice you'd roll is calculated by a system that's for to lengthy to go into here.) The difficulty is a number based on how hard you think the task at hand would be for your character. Rolling a number `>=` the difficulty would `= a success`. Any number `<` the difficulty `= failure`. The reason there is no `<option>` with a value of 1? Because 1 `= botch`. A `botch` is **worse** than a `failure`, I **assure** you. They cancel out your successes. I figured all this would be easier to add up using an `<ol>`.

The other part came about when I learned about ["The Kojima Name Generator"](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/11/11/20959269/unraveled-kojima-name-generator-death-stranding) which seemed fun, but I found a problem. I have no numbered dice! Now you're probably wondering:

Luke, why don't you go and by some dice from one of the small businesses that sell such things?! They need the money!

Well, the thing is...I'm kinda strapped for cash. And I was taught that if you can't afford something, but you have the knowledge and money to make such a thing, then make it. So, that's what I did.

I added those pop-up modals for a little dramatic flair. To make learning what you've rolled a bit more interesting, I guess.

And yes, the name of this project **does** , in fact, come from that song by The Rolling Stones.

**Enjoy!**
