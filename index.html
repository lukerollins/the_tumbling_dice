    <!-- This is the part that was inspired by my desire to maybe attempt some writing and a random number generator that my buddy used in lieu of dice in my brief roleplaying career when I wore a teenagers clothes. Because of this I have some of the The World Of Darkness' Storyteller/Table-top books, so I figured I'd use some thing along the lines of their system to decide what should happen to my characters. That's I created a select input with 9 values 2-10. See, in the aforementioned system you'll roll a number of dice calculated by a system that's waay to lengthy to go into right now, and difficulty number based on how hard the task at hand would be for your character. Anything below that number is a 'failure' The reason there is no option 1: 1 means 'botch' which is a 'dramatic failure' (read, really bad). They also cancel out your successes, which I figured would be easier to count using an ordered list.   -->
